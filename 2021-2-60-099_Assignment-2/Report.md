# Robot Task Optimization Using Genetic Algorithm

This project aimed to develop a system that efficiently assigns tasks to robots in a dynamic production environment. Using Genetic Algorithm (GA), we try to find optimal task assignments that minimize total production time, balance workload across robots, and prioritize critical tasks. The project concludes with an analysis of robot efficiency, task priority, workload distribution, and potential areas for further improvement.








## Methodology

To tackle the task of making sure our robots work efficiently, we used something called a Genetic Algorithm (GA). This means we taught our computers to think like nature doesâ€”by evolving and adapting over time.

Genetic Algorithm (GA) Implementation:

- Initially, tasks are randomly assigned to robots.

- The GA evaluates assignments based on time, workload balance, and task priorities.

After running the algorithm, we created a clear picture to show which robot was doing what task, how well they were doing it, and which tasks were most important. This helped us see how the system was working and understand what we could improve.


## Analysis

1. Influence of Robot Efficiency and Task Priority:

- Higher robot efficiency leads to faster task completion and reduced production time.

- Proper task prioritization ensures critical tasks are completed promptly, further reducing production time.

- The GA adapts to prioritize critical tasks efficiently, improving overall performance.

2. Workload Distribution among Robots:
- Balanced workload among robots ensures efficient resource utilization.

- The GA optimizes assignments to prevent overloading any single robot while maintaining productivity.

- Even workload distribution contributes to minimizing production time.
## Conclusion
The Genetic Algorithm successfully optimizes task assignments for multiple robots in a dynamic production environment. The analysis highlights the significant impact of robot efficiency and task priority on optimization outcomes.
