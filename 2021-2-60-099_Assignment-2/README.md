# Task Assignment Optimization with Genetic Algorithm

This repository contains a project focused on optimizing task assignment for multiple robots in a dynamic production environment using a Genetic Algorithm (GA).

## Overview

The project aims to minimize total production time, balance workload among robots, and prioritize critical tasks effectively. The primary components include:
- **Source Code**: Implementation of the Genetic Algorithm for task assignment optimization.
- **README.md**: Overview of the project, files, requirements, and usage instructions.

## Files

- `Assignment-2_CSE366_2021-2-60-099.ipynb`: Jupyter Noebook script containing the implementation of the Genetic Algorithm for task assignment optimization.

## Requirements

- Jupyter Notebook
- matplotlib
- numpy

## How to Use

1. Open the source file with Jupyter Notebook
2. Run the file
3. View the optimized results of the robots
