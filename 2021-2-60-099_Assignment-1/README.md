#Assignment :
## Enhanced Dynamic Robot Movement Simulation

#
###Abstract:
This project simulates a robot navigating a changing grid world. The robot moves, uses energy, and avoids obstacles. We compare two pathfinding strategies and visualize the robot's journey. We also include ways to make the robot move smarter and safer.
###
###Methodology:
We create a changing 10x10 grid world with obstacles, a starting point, and an ending point. The robot, represented by an "Agent," can move around, use energy, and avoid obstacles. We use two ways (UCS and A*) for the robot to find the best path while using less energy. We use tools to visualize the world and the robot's journey. Finally, we make the robot move smarter by using less energy and avoiding obstacles.

###Previously added:
  - Node class is unchanged
  - PriorityQueue and Heuristic is unchanged
  - Environment class is unchanged
#
###Newly added:
 - Battery parcentage was added later in Agent class
 - Also battery can be recharged
 - The charging point will also be mentioned in output.
 #
###Conclusion:
This project successfully simulated a robot navigating a dynamic environment while considering energy efficiency and safety. By using pathfinding algorithms and incorporating task optimization strategies, we gained valuable insights into efficient robot navigation in real-world scenarios.
